#include<stdio.h>
int main (){
int num, bin=0, place=1;
printf("Enter number");
scanf("%d", &num);
int num1=num;
//logic(for adding number to the beginning we multiply it by the place value and continuous addition) 
while(num!=0){
int rem = num%2;
bin = bin + rem*place;
num = num/2;
place = place*10;(system doesnt accepts leading zeros)
}
printf("Binary  %d is %d", num1, bin);
return 0;
}
for other conversions just replace 2 by other numbers like = 8,16.
